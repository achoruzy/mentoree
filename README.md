# MENTOREE
v 0.1

Mentoree is an open framework for easily managing local communities in matter of finding mentors and apprentices.

--- 

### The idea
Randomly finding a mentor is always a pain but offering mentoring isn't much better.

It is hard to find, hard to ask, difficult to match with others at many levels. That's why this framework is created. To help people find right mentors and apprentices.

The idea is simple. Add an issue, follow `THE RULES` and wait for someone to connect.

#### THE RULES
1. PAYMENT FREE INITIATIVE
2. Be nice and friendly
3. Get the basics before you start looking for a mentor
4. Be an egoless mentor

### How to use it if you look for a mentor
Create an issue titeled with the template below:

Template: `Apprentice in <your main learning expectation>` (eg. "Apprentice in Python, Webdev") with the label `I'm looking for a mentor`

and in the first message describe you and your experience and expectations. Then wait for people responses and find a mentor for you. You choose the one!

### How to use it if you're offering mentoring
Create an issue titeled with the template below:

Template: `Mentor in <your main mentoring expectation>` (eg. "Mentor in SecOps") with the label `I'm offering mentoring`

and in the first message describe you and your experience and expectations. Then wait for people responses and find a mentoree for you. You choose the one!

### How to use it for your community
Just `FORK` the repo for your community, whatever it is. This framork will work for any type of craftsmanship. It is done the way to be independent of activities.

When forked, be sure your `LABELS` at `Issues` are the same as here or below. It is important to keep the framework operating right.
